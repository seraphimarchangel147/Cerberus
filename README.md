# OpenAGI

**An always-on, local-first agent that remembers, watches, and learns your patterns.**

> Local. Private. Always learning. Bring your own LLM. Your data never leaves your machine.

**Website:** [openagi.sh](https://openagi.sh) · **Source:** [github.com/Spshulem/openAGI](https://github.com/Spshulem/openAGI)

OpenAGI is a daemon that runs on your laptop, server, or Raspberry Pi. It hosts a chat UI, executes tools, schedules prompts, watches your screen activity (opt-in), and detects repeating patterns over days — then proposes auto-generated skills you can accept with one click. Everything lives under `~/.openagi/` on your machine. No accounts. No telemetry. No cloud component.

Channels → Signals → Workflows → Directional Adaptive Scrutiny
       → Agent Layer + Tools → Tiered Memory → Propagation
       → Outputs → Feedback
```

## Three pillars

### 1. Remembers you
Every conversation, every correction, every decision lives in tiered memory — short-term for working context, medium for repeated patterns, long-term **Lava** for durable truths. The agent doesn't reset between sessions. Corrections you make once never have to be made twice. The seven-axis **Scrutiny layer** scores every signal before acting (`act / ask / watch / ignore / propagate`). Risky or repeated tasks spawn bounded specialists — specialization without sprawl.

### 2. Watches you work _(killer feature)_
Turn on local screen capture and OpenAGI starts noticing the things you do over and over: the file you keep moving, the report you build every Friday, the script you run after every deploy. Once it sees a pattern enough times, it drafts a skill for it and surfaces it in the dashboard with one-click accept/reject. Powered by **ScreenCaptureKit + Vision OCR + SQLite FTS5** on macOS — entirely on-device. Off by default, opt-in per workspace, default-deny exclusion list (1Password, banking, private windows).

### 3. Yours
Everything OpenAGI sees, learns, and remembers lives in `~/.openagi/` on your machine. No accounts. No telemetry. No remote dependencies beyond the model API key you choose to provide. Use any LLM — OpenAI, Anthropic, or any provider speaking the OpenAI Responses API. Swap models any time. The agent you raise belongs to you.

OpenAGI builds on the local-first foundation that [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) and PicoClaw shipped first — durable memory, MCP registry, daemon shape. The differentiation is the three highlighted rows: **watching you work**, **scoring every signal before acting**, and **bounded specialization**.

---

## Quickstart (60 seconds)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Spshulem/openAGI && cd openAGI
npm install
npm run serve
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:43210/`. The first-run wizard asks for an OpenAI or Anthropic key (or skip — runs in deterministic mode without one), runs a smoke test, and you're chatting.

---

## Install

All install paths end with a daemon listening on `127.0.0.1:43210` and a setup wizard at `/setup`.

### Linux (one-line installer)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Spshulem/openAGI/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

Auto-detects Docker vs. native systemd, installs Node if missing, sets up the service, prints the wizard URL.

### macOS / Linux (from source)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Spshulem/openAGI && cd openAGI
npm install
npm run serve                # http://127.0.0.1:43210/setup
```

For always-on:

```bash
npm run install-launchd      # macOS — auto-start at login + auto-restart on crash
npm run install-systemd      # Linux — same, via systemd (sudo for system-wide; pass 'user' for rootless)
```

### macOS native menu bar app

A SwiftUI menubar app that bundles Node + the runtime + Sparkle auto-update + screen capture + replay confirmation:

```bash
./scripts/build-mac-app.sh                            # unsigned local build
SIGN_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: ..." \
  NOTARIZE=1 DMG=1 \
  AC_USERNAME=... AC_PASSWORD=... AC_TEAM_ID=... \
  ./scripts/build-mac-app.sh                          # signed, notarized .dmg
```

Output: `build/OpenAGI.app` (+ optional `.dmg`). See [`mac/README.md`](mac/README.md) for Sparkle key setup, hardened-runtime entitlements, and release signing.

### Docker / Linux SBC (Raspberry Pi, Jetson, x86)

```bash
docker run -d --name openagi \
  -p 43210:43210 -v openagi-data:/data \
  ghcr.io/spshulem/openagi:latest
```

Multi-arch image (`linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64`). Or with compose:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose -f docker-compose.example.yml up -d
```

### Updates

```bash
npm run update                 # auto-detects mode (docker/systemd/launchd/source) and updates in place
npm run install-update-timer   # Linux: install a weekly auto-update timer (Sundays 04:00)
```

For Docker, run [Watchtower](https://containrrr.dev/watchtower/) alongside the OpenAGI container. The Mac native `.app` updates via Sparkle automatically.

## What's wired

| Capability | Detail |
|------------|--------|
| **Chat UI** | `/` — sessions sidebar, message thread, tabs for Memory / Cron / Skills / MCP / Agents / Channels / Activity. SSE event stream so the UI updates live. |
| **Tool-use loop** | When `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set, the agent uses tool calling with structured args. Default model: `gpt-5`. |
| **Internal tools** | `remember`, `recall`, `schedule_message`, `list_sessions`, `list_skills`, `run_skill`, `list_mcp_tools`, `run_mcp_tool`, `register_mcp_server`, `connect_mcp_server`, `disconnect_mcp_server`, `list_cron_jobs`, `cancel_cron_job`, `get_audit`, `get_budget`, `set_provider`, `retire_specialist`, `replay_skill`. |
| **Skills** | Drop a `SKILL.md` (frontmatter + body) under `.openagi/skills/<name>/` — it shows up as a first-class tool the agent can invoke. |
| **Auto-skill mining** | Pattern-miner runs nightly, detects repeating activity sequences, LLM proposes a skill, lands in `.openagi/skills-suggested/` for one-click accept. Session-miner does the same on chat history. |
| **Skill replay** | Action vocabulary (`open_app`, `keyboard_shortcut`, `applescript`, `shortcut`, `type`, `wait`, `say`, `browser`, ...) — Mac executor confirms first run with a modal, persists trust. |
| **MCP execution** | Register stdio or HTTP+OAuth MCP servers in `.openagi/mcp.json` (or via the UI). On connect, every tool the server advertises becomes a callable agent tool (`mcp_<server>_<tool>`). |
| **Cron prompts** | The agent can call `schedule_message({prompt, delaySeconds | intervalSeconds | dailyAt, channel, target})`. When the job fires, the daemon runs the prompt and routes the reply to the originating channel (SMS, Telegram, local). |
| **SMS bidirectional** | Twilio inbound webhook → agent reply via TwiML. Twilio outbound REST for proactive sends and scheduled fires. |
| **Telegram** | Webhook (`/channels/telegram/webhook`) or long polling (`TELEGRAM_POLLING=1`). |
| **Persistent state** | All under `.openagi/`: memory (JSONL audit + atomic snapshot), cron jobs, agent/session store, specialist workspaces, MCP logs. |

---

## Remote access (SMS, Telegram, tunneling)

Once the daemon is running locally, you can reach it from anywhere via SMS or Telegram by pairing it with a public tunnel.

> Full step-by-step including tunnel + auth + Telegram + launchd: [`docs/setup/remote-channels.md`](docs/setup/remote-channels.md). Quick version below.

### Tunnel

```bash
npm run tunnel    # cloudflared (preferred) or ngrok, auto-detected
```

### Twilio bidirectional SMS

1. Drop credentials into `.openagi/.env`:
    ```bash
    TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=AC...
    TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=...
    TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER=+15551234567
    ```
2. Tunnel a public URL: `ngrok http 43210` → copy `https://abcd1234.ngrok-free.app`.
3. In the Twilio console for your number, set the **A MESSAGE COMES IN** webhook to:
    ```
    https://abcd1234.ngrok-free.app/channels/twilio/webhook
    ```
4. Text your number. The reply comes back as TwiML.
5. Schedule an SMS ping:
    ```bash
    curl -s http://127.0.0.1:43210/cron \
      -H "authorization: Bearer $OPENAGI_AUTH_TOKEN" \
      -H 'content-type: application/json' \
      -d '{"name":"morning-nudge","prompt":"One-line motivational sentence.","dailyAt":"08:00","channel":"sms","target":"+15555550123"}'
    ```

### Telegram

Create a bot via [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather), drop the token in `.openagi/.env`:

```bash
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=...
TELEGRAM_POLLING=1               # or set up a webhook to /channels/telegram/webhook
TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET=...      # only if using webhooks
```

---

## Screen capture & pattern mining (macOS)

Off by default. To enable on the macOS native app:

1. Launch `OpenAGI.app`.
2. Click the menu-bar icon → **Capture** → **Enable capture**.
3. macOS prompts for **Screen Recording** + **Accessibility** permissions — grant once.
4. Click **Capture → Privacy settings…** to tune frequency, retention, app/regex exclusions, and disk budget.

Once running:
- Every ~30 seconds the Mac batches activity (window titles + frame OCR) and pushes to the daemon's `/observations` endpoint.
- Nightly at 02:30 UTC, the **pattern miner** clusters repeating sequences and asks the LLM to propose a skill name + description + body.
- Suggested skills land in `.openagi/skills-suggested/` and surface in the dashboard's **Skills → Suggested** section.
- Accept → writes a real `SKILL.md`. If the skill includes a `replay:` block, `replay_skill` invokes it (Mac shows a confirmation modal first run).

Privacy posture (non-negotiable):
- No keystroke logging
- No cloud sync — capture stays local
- Default-deny exclusion list: 1Password, Wallet, banking sites, private/incognito windows, 2FA / OTP screens
- One-click wipe in the privacy panel

---

## MCP servers

Drop a config at `.openagi/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/tmp"],
      "trustLevel": "trusted"
    },
    "my-hosted": {
      "url": "https://mcp.example.com/mcp",
      "auth": "oauth",
      "trustLevel": "trusted"
    }
  }
}
```

Three transport+auth shapes are supported: **stdio** (spawn local process), **http+bearer** (URL with static API key), **http+oauth** (URL with browser-based OAuth — supports both dynamic registration and pre-registered clients).

For the bearer shape, reference your secrets via `.openagi/.env` only — `${VAR}` substitution is allowlisted to keys defined in that file (closes the env-var exfiltration class). Restart the daemon and click **Connect** in the MCP tab — or:

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:43210/mcp/connect/filesystem \
  -H "authorization: Bearer $OPENAGI_AUTH_TOKEN"
```

On connect, each MCP tool becomes a first-class agent tool (`mcp_filesystem_read_file`, etc.) and the model can call it directly.

---

## Skills

Skills are markdown templates the agent can run as sub-prompts. Three are bundled (`recap`, `morning-brief`, `remind`). Add your own at `.openagi/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`:

```markdown
---
name: weekly-review
description: Summarize the past 7 days of memory and propose 3 follow-ups.
replay:
  - say: "Running your weekly review."
  - applescript: |
      tell application "Calendar" to activate
---

You are running a weekly review.

1. Call `recall` with query "this week" to pull recent items.
2. Group by tag, summarize each cluster in one bullet.
3. Propose three follow-ups the user should schedule.

User asked: {{input}}
```

The skill becomes the `skill_weekly_review` tool and is also runnable from the UI's **Skills** tab. The `replay:` block (optional) makes it executable on the Mac via `replay_skill` with a confirmation modal.

---

## Integrations

Integrations are plug-in modules in `src/integrations/<name>.js`. Each one self-registers tools when its credentials are present in env, and silently no-ops otherwise. **No keys live in source.**

Bundled:

| Integration | Env | Tools | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| Rize.io (time tracking) | `RIZE_API_KEY` | `rize_query`, `rize_today_summary`, `rize_recent_sessions` | "What did I work on today?" |

To add another (e.g. Toggl, Linear, GitHub via API), copy `src/integrations/rize.js` as a template:

```js
export function registerYourIntegration(runtime, options = {}) {
  const client = options.client ?? new YourClient(options);
  if (!client.isConfigured()) return { registered: false, reason: "API key not set" };
  runtime.tools.register({ name: "your_tool", parameters: {...}, handler: async (args) => client.something(args) });
  return { registered: true };
}
```

Then add one line to `src/abi-runtime.js`: `registerYourIntegration(this);`

For SaaS that ships an MCP server, you don't need an integration module — just point `.openagi/mcp.json` at it and the agent gets every tool automatically.

---

## Auth & security

When `OPENAGI_AUTH_TOKEN` is unset, the dashboard runs unauthenticated (fine for `127.0.0.1` only). When set, every route except `/health` and the webhook endpoints requires:

- header `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, or
- a `?token=<token>` query (browser convenience — sets a cookie, then redirects), or
- the `openagi_token` cookie.

Generate a strong token:

```bash
node -e "console.log(require('node:crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('base64url'))"
```

Webhooks self-validate instead:

- **Twilio:** when `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` and `OPENAGI_PUBLIC_URL` are set, the daemon verifies the `X-Twilio-Signature` HMAC against the incoming form body.
- **Telegram:** set `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET` and pass the same value as `secret_token` to `setWebhook` — the daemon checks the `X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token` header.

Additional defenses:

- **Cross-origin POST blocked** — any browser request whose `Origin` doesn't match `Host` is rejected with 403, regardless of auth state.
- **MCP register hardening** — `command` is allowlisted to known runners (`npx`, `node`, `bun`, `deno`, `python3`, `uvx`, `docker`); URL hosts may not be loopback / RFC1918 / link-local / cloud-metadata; `${VAR}` substitution is allowlisted to keys explicitly declared in `.openagi/.env`.

## Roadmap

- HTTP / SSE MCP transport for a richer client capability than current stdio.
- Specialist routing — when a message matches a specialist's bounded scope, route to it instead of always `main`.
- Embeddings-backed memory search alongside the current keyword overlap.
- Per-channel delivery policies and retry queues.
- Sparkle release pipeline so the Mac `.app` updates automatically.
